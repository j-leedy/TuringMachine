# Turing Machine

**Developed by:** Sparsh Gupta, Mark Belanger, Noah Rand, Joe Leedy, Will Young

Developed at Olin College of Engineering for the Principles of Integrated Engineering (Fall 2023) final project.


### About
This project is a physical electromechanical implementation of a [Universal Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine) that currently supports basic Turing-computational operations and a few Turing-complete languages.

It could be modified easily to support more Turing-computable operations and Turing-complete languages.

### Operations
List of operations currently supported:

- **anbn** (check whether a string has an equal number of 0s and 1s)

### Strings

Sample string input formats for operations:

**anbn**: 00, 1010, 0100, etc. (any string of even length that consists of 0s and 1s)
