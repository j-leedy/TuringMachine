# Turing Machine

**Developed by:** Sparsh Gupta, Mark Belanger, Noah Rand, Joe Leedy, Will Young

Developed at Olin College of Engineering for the Principles of Integrated Engineering (Fall 2023) final project.


### About
This project is a physical electromechanical implementation of a [Universal Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine) that currently supports basic Turing-computational operations and a few Turing-complete languages.

It could be modified easily to support more Turing-computable operations and Turing-complete languages.

### Operations
List of operations currently implemented:

- Check whether a string is of certain format: 
  - anbn (equal number of 0s and 1s in the string)
